## What is it?

[LunarDB](https://github.com/Kazooki123/lunardb) is a Key-Value, Cache, Memory based database that loads keys and values in a file when saved by command, you can load this keys and values by the command "LOAD" then filename.

## Why did I build this?

For months or even years developers or programmers have been searching for the right and perfect
cache-based memory database.

The first was Memcache (Which basically means Mememory cache) during the early days of programming.

Years and decades later we have Redis, a millisecond fast, cache based in memory but also stores in disk service and database for applications that want a very fast response
time for costumers. 

But Redis today according to **news & article** they went on a new LICENSE change that limits costumers
to use Redis for commercial use. Which frustrated the developer community and the DX (Developer Experience)

**LunarDB** on the other hand, fixes this. I decided to build this side-project to give developers
the database they want. Its free, open source and a enjoyable database as well!

**LunarDB** will sooner make a website manager and GUI manager for users in Windows, MacOS & Linux.
